Finally get used to React, GraphQL, and Gatsby. So I decided to build my personal site/blog around Gatsby cause the render speed is just amazing. And with the markdown support, I only need to copy and paste writings from my Notion App. This is beyond convinient. 

I don't even need to open up the browser, all I need to do is write on my Notion, create a new markdown file, copy and paste the writing, and it automatically converts to markdown format.

Looking further to fill this up with my writings.
